## 2. How to Learn WordPress Basics for Free

> https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-learn-wordpress-for-free-in-a-week-or-less/ - **lots of links to great articles by them**

There are two types of WordPress websites. First, there is WordPress.org also known as self-hosted WordPress, and then there is WordPress.com.

- CMS is a platform that lets you create almost any type of website, from a personal blog to a complex eCommerce store

1. Monday: Getting Started with WordPress

> Typically, a domain costs $14.99 per year, and web hosting starts from $7.99 per month

- âœ… wordpress.org not .com
- âœ… choose your domain name
- âœ… choose web hosting
- âœ… install WordPress - most hosting providers also offer 1-click WordPress installers - e.g. **Softaculous**:
  - âœ… Choose `https://` or `https://www.` as protocol
  - **Most users want to install WordPress in their domain's root directory, like example.com. In that case, you need to make sure that the '`In Directory`' field is blank**
  - âœ… site settings section - you need to provide a title and description for your WordPress site
  - âœ… Next, you need to choose an admin username, password, and email address. Softaculous will automatically fill in the username and password fields for you
  - The rest of the options on the screen are optional. You can now click on the install button to run the installer
  - You will see a progress bar with installation status. It will take a couple of minutes. Do not close the window until the progress bar reaches 100%
  - you then will get a link to your admin area

2. Tuesday: Learning The WordPress Basics

- âœ… dashboard
- âœ… cats vs tags - all WordPress posts must be filed under a category, but they don't need to have tags - it's often helpful to rename the Uncategorized category to something like 'Other' or 'Miscellaneous'. subcategories are helpful if you have a large category with a lot of posts that could be grouped into smaller sections
- ðŸ“Œ Using Categories in Your Post URLs
- âœ… You should only assign posts to multiple categories if it makes the most sense for your readers - _It's possible that having your post in multiple categories could cause some SEO issues due to duplicate content_
- âœ… stick to a maximum of 10 tags per post

> Choose your categories wisely

- âœ… pages vs posts - key differences:
  - Posts are timely, and pages are timeless.
  - You can use categories and tags to organize posts, while pages are hierarchical and organized as child and parent pages.
  - Posts have an author and published date, while pages do not

3. Wednesday: Installing WordPress Plugins

- âœ… The real power of WordPress is in the plugins
- They allow you to add new features to your website, such as adding contact forms, a community forum, a store, online courses, ...

9. ðŸ“Œ Permalink Setting: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/wordpress/wordpress_permalink_setting.htm

- Permalink structure,
- You should save your WordPress permalink settings as soon as you set up your website and choose a permalink structure, ideally before publishing any content, as changing permalinks later can negatively impact your SEO due to potential broken links
- When you re-save the permalink settings in WordPress, it refreshes the rewrite rules and ensures that the URLs are correctly mapped, which typically resolves the 404 errors. Itâ€™s a good practice to do this after major updates or when installing new plugins/themes that could affect your siteâ€™s structure
  - .htaccess: if its rules are altered by an update or plugin, permalinks may break
  - Plugin Conflicts: Some plugins can interfere with permalink structures. When you update WordPress or plugins, these conflicts might arise, necessitating a reset of permalinks
  - Theme Changes: Switching themes or updating your theme can sometimes affect permalink settings, especially if the new theme has different URL structures or relies on certain plugins
  - Server Configuration: Changes in server settings or migrations to different hosting environments can impact how URLs are processed, leading to 404 errors
  - Database Changes: Updates might alter the database structure or how URLs are stored, causing inconsistencies that require a permalink reset

> In WordPress, you have the option of whether or not you will choose to have the www. as part of your domain name. You can toggle this under the â€˜Settingsâ€™ option in WordPress. While this is mostly a visual improvement, it reduces the number of characters that are a part of your permalink. This gives you the flexibility to try and keep your URLs around the 59 character mark

### Getting Started: Getting Started

> https://wordpress.com/learn/courses/getting-started/start-here/

#### ðŸ“Œ Site Editor:

> https://wordpress.com/learn/courses/getting-started/site-editor/

- The Site Editor is a part of the Full Site Editing (FSE) capabilities that have been progressively integrated into WordPress since the release of WordPress 5.9
- you can use blocks to design and customize headers, footers, sidebars, and other areas of your site
- Appearance > Editor
- Clicking anywhere on the preview portion of the screen will open the Site Editor, which is an editor screen that looks similar to the editor used when creating pages
- The name and label in the center at the top of your screen is your first clue to whether youâ€™re editing a template or a page. A gray "page" name means this content is built in a page and paired with a template. A purple "template" name means this content is built directly in the template
- If you click the Settings icon in the top right corner of the editor, youâ€™ll open the Settings sidebar on the right, and here youâ€™ll also see either Template or Page as the label at the top of this sidebar. These are your primary tell-tale signs that you are in the Site Editor and whether you are editing a template or your "content"
- As a rule of thumb, other than for a Default Homepage, avoid editing any page specific content within the Site Editor
- Confirm that youâ€™re seeing the purple template name at the top of the Site Editor screen. If the name at the top of the screen is gray and you see Page at the top of the Settings sidebar, click on the template name in the Settings sidebar to Edit the template???
- If you click the Site Icon image in the top left corner, youâ€™ll close the editing mode and return to the preview mode with the Design panel on the left. From this Design panel you can explore the different options currently available within the Site Editor

ðŸ“Œ Design panel items

- Templates: This section is the primary function of the Site Editor. When you click this section youâ€™ll see a list of active templates that are in use within your site
- Patterns: includes the full library of pre-designed patterns - Itâ€™s also where youâ€™ll find dedicated Header and Footer template parts, and any custom patterns that you create
- Styles: provides quick access to the color palettes - You can click on the palettes in the left panel to apply it to your entire site - The "eye" icon will open the Style Book where you can scroll to see the various styles applied across your site. The "pencil" icon will take you into the editor and open the Styles panel on the right
- Pages: In this section you can access your site pages, and you can even edit them directly in the Site Editor. The Manage All Page link at the bottom will take you back to the main Pages section accessed from the main dashboard. There is nothing wrong with editing page content from this section, just remember that these are pages and youâ€™re editing content - Edits you make here are the same as editing the content from the Pages section of your main dashboard. The page settings available within the Site Editor are also limited to what youâ€™ll find from the main Page section
- Navigation

#### ðŸ“Œ Templates Explained (STOPPED HERE for Summary.md)

> FUCKING HUGE PAGE WITH WAY TOO MUCH INFORMATION

> https://wordpress.com/learn/courses/getting-started/templates-explained/

- The release of the Site Editor and access to templates has opened up a world of possibilities that previously only developers could truly tap into
- Templates function as full-page layouts (or blueprints), composed of various blocks, to organize the page structure into sections.
- They use template parts for the header and footer, which are reusable, synced patterns of blocks. Templates also include a content area.
- It also helps to understand that there are two main types of templates: multi-use templates and single use templates
- Every page or post within your website has the same basic anatomy. You can make it look vastly different on any given page or post, but the core elements are the same. There is a Header Area, a Content Area, and a Footer Area
- Content (your pages and posts) and Theme (your templates and styles)
- You use the Site Editor to build the overall structure, layout, and design aspects of your "theme" by managing your templates, template parts, and styles
- Block themes also offer specialized templates like the 404 error page, the Search results page, the All Archives for category, tag, or author archives, and more. You can also add custom templates as desired.
- While each theme may come with its own unique set of templates pre-activated, most themes will include at least the following base templates:
  - All Archives
  - Index
  - Page: 404
  - Pages
  - Search Results
  - Single Posts
- Appearance > Editor > Templates

ðŸ“Œ Multi-use templates:

- templates that you pair with regular pages and posts. In most situations, youâ€™ll use one template for multiple pages and one template for multiple posts. The default template for pages is always the template called "Pages"
- The default template for posts is always the template called "Single Posts".
- Aside from the default Pages and Single Posts templates, the only other multi-use templates are `custom templates` that either come pre-created with your theme or that you create
- When working with a multi-use template itâ€™s important to remember that the changes you make to these templates will affect all of the regular pages and posts within your site that are using them
- you donâ€™t want to add page or post specific content to either of these templates

> **But you may decide to add a Cover block, assign it to use the Featured Image, and place the page or post Title block in the Cover block â€” this would then act as a custom header per page or post, and will be dynamic for each page or post**

> **Important!** Itâ€™s also critical to remember that these multi-use templates must include the "Content" block.

> **Note**: When youâ€™re editing your page or post content, you wonâ€™t see the pieces that are part of your multi-use template, such as the Header or Footer, youâ€™ll only see the page or post specific content

> **Pro tip**: It is possible to access your Pages content from the Design panel within the Site Editor. From the Page or Post Editor, you can also access the assigned template a specific page or post is using from the Settings sidebar

- Or, you may decide to add a Columns block with a wide left column for your Content block and a narrow right column to set up a sidebar with specific blocks
- When youâ€™re editing a multi-use template in the Site Editor, you wonâ€™t see your "content" for regular pages and posts. Instead youâ€™ll see dynamic placeholder blocks for your content such as Content, Title, Featured Image and more. (Also note that your homepage may behave differently, which we cover in the Homepage and Posts Page lesson.)
- **Pro tip**: It is possible to access your Pages content from the Design panel within the Site Editor
- For beginners, we recommend going to the Pages and Posts sections of your main dashboard to edit page and post content, and to Appearance > Editor to access the Templates section of the Site Editor to edit templates, and keep a clear distinction between the two

ðŸ“Œ Single-use templates

- Single-use templates mean that you cannot assign them to multiple pages or posts, and the content they display is controlled directly in the template
- The most common single-use templates: homepage (index or blog home or front page), 404, search
- When you activate a new Block theme, the Default Homepage is assigned as your homepage automatically

  - You can edit every aspect of your homepage directly in this template as desired
  - Editing the Default Homepage content wonâ€™t affect your other pages

ðŸ“Œ AVAILBABLE TEMPLATES:

1. Home: blog page if it is set as the homepage
2. Index: used to display the index page of all the blog posts
3. Pages:
4. 404
5. Search
6. Archive
7. Custom Template: A template that can be applied to any post or page
8. Front Page
9. Author Archives
10. Category archives
11. Date archives
12. Tag archives
13. Taxonomy

> **Note**: The Search Results page comes with a Query Loop block in place and pre-configured to display your search results. We recommend leaving the configuration for the Query Loop block as is in order for it to properly display search results. However, within the Query Loop block there is the Post Template that includes a collection of blocks in a specific layout. You can rearrange these Post Template blocks however you like

> **Pro Tip**: `Pages: [Specific Page]` - provides the ability to create a custom template that can only be used with one specific page - It can behave like a multi-use template that merges with just one specific page or like a single-use template where you build the content directly in the template. The Single Item: Post template offers the same functionality for posts, but is less commonly misused 5. Single Post: customize the layout of single blog posts

> **???**: If you choose the Pages template option and you select a specific page from the list (`HOW?`), this new custom template will only apply to the page you assign it to on creation. You cannot apply this template to any other page **???**

> This pro tip has a lot of info so read it completely and understand it all

ðŸ“Œ Template parts and special blocks

- itâ€™s worth investigating what types of blocks and template parts are added to your templates by default
- The template youâ€™re investigating will determine which blocks you see in the List View, but may include: Header, Content, Query Loop, and/or Footer

1. Header: It may be nested inside other blocks such as a Group or Column. It will use a purple icon color in the List View
2. Content: This is a placeholder block to represent where in your template your regular page or post content will be displayed. This block is required for any multi-use templates - In the case of a single-use template this block would be replaced with a collection of specific content blocks
3. Query Loop: This is a dynamic block used to display the published posts in your site
4. Footer: Itâ€™s not typically nested inside other blocks. Itâ€™s usually the last block on any template and spans the full width of the template. It will use a purple icon color in the List View

- A template part is a reusable synced pattern of blocks that can be placed within multiple templates. When you change the pieces of a template part in one place it will update across all locations of your site that are using it
- The templates provided by a theme come with a default Header template part and a default Footer template part, and these will usually be the same template parts across all templates
- These template parts are something that both multi-use and single-use templates have in common
- You can replace an existing template part on any given template by following these steps:
  - Select the specific template part in the List View
  - Click the 3 dots on in the toolbar
  - Select Replace
- This will open a modal showing your existing template parts and additional patterns that you can use instead. When you choose a new pattern it will automatically save it as an existing template part
- **A common use case for this is when you want your homepage to display a larger, hero image type header with a call-to-action button, but you want a simple, single row header on the rest of your pages** - you could create a header template part called "Homepage Header"

> Remember, if you edit the default Header template part in your Default Homepage template, it will change the header that displays on your regular pages and posts as well. So if you want them to be different, replace the Header template part instead

- You can get extremely creative with this feature by creating custom header template parts to combine with specific templates to use for different categories or sections within your site
- You may also notice that some blocks have a lock icon next to them in the List View. This is a good reminder that you shouldnâ€™t delete that particular block
- Appearance > Editor > Patterns
- You can duplicate existing template parts, edit them, and create new ones. Each template part must have its own unique name
- Template parts cannot be used directly within Pages or Posts, theyâ€™re only available for Templates. The Content block used in multi-use templates also canâ€™t be used directly within specific pages or posts
- However, the one other place the Content block can be used is within the Query Loop block. If youâ€™ve set up a Custom Posts Page, and you want the page to display the full content of each of your posts, you can add the Content block instead of the Excerpt block, within the Query Loop block that you place within a specific page
- There are a number of other content specific blocks found in templates such as: Title, Featured Image, Date, Author, Comments, and more. While these are content specific blocks, they can be used within both templates and content (such as pages or posts) depending on your desired use case

Wrapping up

- Themes provide the overall design parameters of your site. Site wide theme customizations are managed through the Styles section of the Site Editor.
- Templates define the overall structure for pages and posts. Theyâ€™re created and edited in the Templates section of the Site Editor. Multi-use templates merge with the content of your pages and posts. Single-use templates contain the content directly in the template.
- Layouts are the arrangement of blocks, also called patterns, that you use on pages, posts, and templates.

ðŸ“Œ Points to remember:

- Themes come with pre-activated templates assigned to specific types of content: Homepage, Pages, Posts, Archives and more.
- Templates are either multi-use (one template that merges with multiple pages or posts) or single-use (content is built directly in the template for a single purpose).
- You can create custom multi-use templates.
- You can assign multi-use templates on a per page or post basis.
- All templates are built using blocks, the same as pages or posts.
- The most important block in any multi-use template being used for regular pages or posts is the "Content" block. This is the block that will merge your template with your content on the front end of your site. If you remove this block from a template, your website wonâ€™t display any of the content from your pages or posts that are using this template.
- Any blocks that you add to a multi-use template will display on all pages or posts that are using that template.
- Some blocks found in the Site Editor are unique to templates, meaning they donâ€™t work in a regular page or post. (Such as the Header or Footer template parts.)
- Template parts represent global components of your site, like Headers and Footers, that can be created and edited within templates. Similar to `Synced Patterns`, any changes you make to template parts will apply across all templates that are using those template parts.
- You can use different template parts on different templates.
- You can customize templates that come pre-activated with your theme, and you can clear those customizations, but you canâ€™t delete templates that come pre-activated with your theme.
- You can create custom templates and delete custom templates, `but you can't clear customizations to reset them`.
- **All editors include an undo button and a Revision History section to revert changes youâ€™ve made**.
- Templates and template parts do not transfer between themes when you switch themes. (But you can always switch back to a previous theme to find your previous templates and template parts.) If you want to transfer content built within a template to a new theme, youâ€™ll want to create a pattern of the content, or copy the content to a page: Transfer Content From the Site Editor

### Editing Templates

> https://wordpress.com/learn/courses/create-your-site/editing-templates/

...focus on editing: templates and template parts

**Synced patterns**: you can arrange blocks in unlimited ways and save them as patterns for use throughout your site, directly within the editing experience. You can also specify whether to sync your patterns, so that one change applies to all parts of your site, or to keep them unsynced, so you can customize each instance

ðŸ“Œ Important points: (THIS IS A REPEAT?)

- Templates are either multi-use (one template that merges with multiple pages or posts) or single-use (content is built directly in the template for a single purpose).
- You can create custom multi-use templates
- You can assign multi-use templates on a per page or post basis
- You can use different template parts on different templates
- You can customize templates that come pre-activated with your theme, and you can clear those customizations, but you canâ€™t delete templates that come pre-activated with your theme
- You can create custom templates and delete custom templates, but you canâ€™t clear customizations to reset them
- All editors include an undo button and a Revision History section to revert changes youâ€™ve made

**Multi-use templates**:

- a template that will be used to handle the structure of multiple pages or posts

Example:

- Appearance > Editor > Templates click on the template called Pages then click the pencil icon, or anywhere in the preview window to open the editor
- open the List View in the editor for the template and explore
- In most cases the structure of the blocks in the Pages template will follow a general format of: Header area; Content area; Footer area
- You can also see that there is no "content" displayed in this template. The blocks within the Content area are all placeholders for the content that you build within your individual pages

> Ideally, youâ€™ve chosen a theme that provides a default layout that you like as is, and you shouldnâ€™t need to adjust the content area of the template

. . . . . . . . . .

ðŸ“Œ Header:

...tweak your Header template part

- add your Site Logo, or remove the Site Title block
- The process of adding and removing blocks in a template part works the same as anywhere else in the editor
- NOTE: if you change the default Header template part in the Pages template, it will also change this same Header template part in your other templates

But, you may also decide that you want to use a different header entirely. Fortunately, you can replace the Header template part with a different one with just a few clicks

1. Select the Header template part in the List View
2. Click the 3 dots to the right of it
3. Click on Replace
4. In the modal that will open, browse through the available patterns and choose a different one
5. Youâ€™ll notice that the name of your Header template part in the List View will change to the name of the new pattern youâ€™ve selected

Replacing the Header template part in one template, such as the Pages template, wonâ€™t affect the Header template part being used in other templates. If you want other templates to use this new Header template part, youâ€™ll want to repeat the above steps in each applicable template

IF like to add a banner image near the top of every page (not in the header) only that displays the Featured Image for each page with the Page Title on top of the image. Hereâ€™s how you would achieve that: (Pages template)

1. Click on the Header template part in the List View
2. Click the 3 dots to the right
3. Click Add after
4. In the empty Paragraph block that appears type: `/image` and select the Image block from the list
5. add an image
6. Select the image you added
7. In the block toolbar click the image icon then select `Cover` (this transforms the Image block to be a Cover block)
8. In the Settings sidebar on the right, scroll down and click the Clear Media button
9. In the block toolbar click the Add Media option
10. Select the option to `Use Featured Image` (this is now a placeholder block and you wonâ€™t see an actual image display in the editor)
11. drag the `Title` block to be inside in the Cover block, or it that block isn't there click in the text area of the Cover block and type: `/title` and select it from the list to add it
12. Style the Title block as desired using the options in the block toolbar and the Settings sidebar
13. Save the template in the top right corner, click Save again to confirm

Go back to the tab with the front end of your site and refresh the page. Youâ€™ll see a banner that includes your page title. If youâ€™ve already assigned a Featured Image to your pages, that image will be the background behind your page title. If you have not yet assigned a Featured Image to a page, the banner will display as a solid color background

You can further tweak the `Cover` block and the `Title` block in the Pages template within the Site Editor if you need to adjust settings like the opacity of the image or how the page title displays

> add this Cover block banner below the Header template part. This ensures that this Cover block banner will only apply to the pages using the default Pages template

If youâ€™d like your Posts to also include this Cover block banner, you can copy the Cover block from your Pages template (click the three dots in the block toolbar and click Copy). Then:

1. Open the Single Posts template
2. Select the Header template part from the List View
3. Click the 3 dots to the right of it
4. Click Add after
5. Then paste into the empty Paragraph block

This will retain any styling that you applied to the Cover block and Title block without you having to set it up from scratch again

ðŸ“Œ Footer

You can replace the default Footer template part the same way as you replace the Header template part.

If your theme isnâ€™t using a Footer template part, you can add one by adding a new block at the bottom of your template and type: `/footer`. This will add a default Footer that you can then Replace with any pattern.

#### ðŸ“Œ Single-use templates

When working with a single-use template, you are editing the content directly in the template. There wonâ€™t be a Content block, and there may or may not be a Query Loop block. Whatever content you want these templates to display, you add, remove, and edit it in the template

Examples of single-use templates include:

- Default Homepage (Index, Blog Home, Home, or Front Page)
- Page: 404
- Search Results

Even the All Archives is a type of single-use template in that you donâ€™t specifically assign this template to individual pages or posts. Instead, this template is used to create the desired layout structure for custom post types such as: authors, categories, tags, and more. You can use the All Archives template for all of these custom post types, or you can create custom archive templates for each type of custom post. For example, you could create a custom Category Archive template for each of your categories in order to customize the look for each of your categories

When youâ€™re editing the content on any single-use template, itâ€™s the same process as editing the content of a page or post: add, remove, or edit the blocks within the template. **`You can also use Block Patterns within these templates to help with quickly creating professional layout designs`**

Homepage header:

if youâ€™d like your Default Homepage template to use a different Header template part

1. Open the editor for the Default Homepage template
2. In the List View, select the Header template part
3. Click the 3 dots to the right
4. Select Replace
5. Browse and choose whatever pattern youâ€™d like to use for your Homepage header

#### Editing templates summary

Points to remember:

- Themes come with pre-activated templates assigned to specific types of content: Homepage, Pages, Posts, Archives and more.
- Templates are either multi-use (one template that merges with multiple pages or posts) or single-use (content is built directly in the template for a single purpose).
- You can create custom multi-use templates.
- You can assign multi-use templates on a per page or post basis. (`HOW?`)
- All templates are built using blocks, the same as pages or posts.
- The most important block in any multi-use template being used for regular pages or posts is the "Content" block. This is the block that will merge your template with your content on the front end of your site. If you remove this block from a template, your website wonâ€™t display any of the content from your pages or posts that are using this template.
- Any blocks that you add to a multi-use template will display on all pages or posts that are using that template.
- Some blocks found in the Site Editor are unique to templates, meaning they donâ€™t work in a regular page or post. (Such as the Header or Footer template parts.)
- Template parts represent global components of your site, like Headers and Footers, that can be created and edited within templates. Similar to `Synced Patterns`, any changes you make to template parts will apply across all templates that are using those template parts.
- You can use different template parts on different templates.
- You can customize templates that come pre-activated with your theme, and you can clear those customizations, but you canâ€™t delete templates that come pre-activated with your theme.
- You can create custom templates and delete custom templates, but you canâ€™t clear customizations to reset them.
- All editors include an undo button and a Revision History section to revert changes youâ€™ve made.
- Templates and template parts do not transfer between themes when you switch themes. (But you can always switch back to a previous theme to find your previous templates and template parts.) If you want to transfer content built within a template to a new theme, youâ€™ll want to create a pattern of the content, or copy the content to a page: Transfer Content From the Site Editor

### ðŸ“Œ Homepage and Posts Page

> https://wordpress.com/learn/courses/getting-started/homepage-and-posts-page/

- **Pro-tip**: For a consistent and straightforward website design experience we recommend using the Default Homepage and creating a Custom Posts Page
- **Default Homepage**: The content is built in a specific template as set by the theme. Under Settings > Reading - the Homepage option is set to: - Default -
- **Custom Homepage**: The content is built in a regular page, it will be assigned a multi-use template, and the page needs to be assigned as the homepage under Settings > Reading. (A Custom Homepage is the same as any other regular page.)
- **Front Page** template: Many newer themes are being designed using this template, it's also a template that you can add to any theme. It's unique and it's also much more versatile - the Front Page template will always be your site's homepage

1. Confirm Front Page template is active under Appearance > Editor > Templates
2. Build content "in" the template
3. Create a regular page called Home
4. Add a featured image and excerpt as desired
5. Leave the page editor blank
6. Publish the page
7. Under Settings > Reading: assign the page as the Homepage
8. Access the Front Page template under Appearance > Editor > Templates for future content edits

Custom Homepage:

- A Custom Homepage is really nothing more than a regular page paired with a multi-use template
- Provided your theme is not using the Front Page template, to use a Custom Homepage, you'll create a new page which will use the default Pages template and assign it as the Homepage under Settings > Reading

> With new Block themes, it's pretty rare to work with a Custom Homepage

Posts page:

- our recommendation is to work with a Custom Posts Page on any site using a Block theme

To set up a Custom Posts Page:

- create a new regular page
- add the desired page layout or block patterns (ensuring to include dynamic blocks that will display posts)
- use the default Pages template (Huh, why not use index or Home?)

> Under Settings > Reading: make sure that you do not have any specific published page assigned as the Posts Page. In the default WordPress.com view, this is achieved by leaving the drop down box as - None - `???`

- With a Custom Posts Page, you have complete control over the layout of the page.
- And with the ability to now create custom templates, you have more control than ever to make your Posts page look exactly the way you want

#### Plan Your Homepage

> https://wordpress.com/learn/courses/getting-started/plan-your-homepage/

**Section 1 - Header**

- Site Title | Site Tagline (Optional) | Site Logo | Navigation | Search

**Section 2 - Intro**

This section should include a brief description of what your site is about and why it matters to your audience

- Background image (optional)
- Welcome message (brief)
- Primary action you'd like visitors to take (optional)
- Button that will link to the action (optional)

> Sections 1 and 2 can be combined into one section

**Section 3 - Highlight your offerings**:

...the purpose of your site will be most prominent. This part should emphasize what you offer - There are various ways to approach this, but we recommend a three-column layout, with each column featuring a heading, description, and image, e.g.:

- Services you offer
- Products you want to showcase
- Blog category topics
- Most recent blog posts
- Featured blog posts
- Courses you offer
- Three of your key pages

**Section 4 - Latest posts (optional)**:

- Using dynamic blocks, such as the Query Loop block, this section will give your visitors a taste of what information theyâ€™ll find on your site

**Section 5 â€” About (me or us)**:

Include a brief description about yourself (or your company or team) with just one or two points as to why youâ€™re the best, most qualified, or most passionate about providing this information

**Section 6 - Encourage followers / subscribers**:

- include a section on your homepage for visitors to subscribe to your site and content
- This should be the last piece on your homepage, after the reader has gotten a sense of what your website is about, why itâ€™s of value to them, what kind of information or resources youâ€™re providing, and who you are
- After all of that, it makes sense to ask them to subscribe to your site or newsletter
- consider including some other email-list building subscribe option using a plugin such as MailPoet

**Section 7 - Footer**:

- Contact information | Map | Social links | Important links

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Site Editing: Custom Headers

> https://wordpress.com/learn/webinars/site-editing-custom-headers/ - 56:45

- duplicate your existing header
- in template parts click `+` > name it > choose Header > search for Header and choose the purple one that is capitalized > open list view > click Header > click the 3 vertical dots with the Header selected > select "Detach blocks from template part" > Save > Save
- you want to choose "Insert after" so that the new row block is not inside the group but follows it

> `/row` - allows you to set Justification like "space between" - it's a group block that groups blocks horizontally
> Options in the right sidebar with icons are: Group, Row, Stack
> What's the difference between Group and Stack

- he built his home page with page no title > click the text Edit to edit that - select the header > 3 vertical dots > Replace header
- click the Cover element and you can drag the bottom part to shrink or enlarge that block
- under settings/gear for the cover block you can change the focal point for the image

.......................................................................

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Site Editor vs. Page Editor

> https://wordpress.com/learn/webinars/site-editor-vs-page-editor/

- **Page Editor**: where you add your content for pages and posts
- **Site Editor**: both use blocks but in the page editor they are used for your content, in the site editor they are used for your structure/templates
- if you edit the header and footer of a template those changes will be saved to those template parts

> The Site Editor makes global changes, Page Editor only changes that page/post

........................................................................

## ðŸ“Œ 4. Building a home page with a block theme

> https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/building-a-home-page-with-a-block-theme/

- create a blank page named Home and Blog - set them as the pages
- in page view you will see "Posts Page" and "Front Page"
- when he opened his Home page he says "Notice that it is assigned to the 'Default template'" but mine says "Pages"
- Click on Pages and select "Create new template"

> Pretty good but this shit is fucked up

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Improving Site Performance: An overview

> https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/improving-site-performance-an-overview/

- What is Site Performance: how fast your pages load

What impedes Site Performance

- Hosting: shared hosting, hardware performance, geographic distance, server load, too few servers
- Software version & performance: WP configuration ("heavy" theme, many plugins - resource heavy), size of graphics, size of DB/content

Optimize your software:

- minimize plugins
- optimize content: optimize images, reduce file size, minify
- upgrade hardware: increase server RAM, add **SSD drives/processors**

Optimize your site:

- use a managed WP hosting solution: the host takes care of all the system stuff - they help with the cache, up time,
- do not run a DNS service on your WP site: ???
- use techniques like server caching:
- modify your server: `Apache Litespeed`, or modify site configuration using `MemCache`
- PHP accelerators like `APc` and `OPcache`
- MySQL optimization

Caching:

> temporary storage of pages/images to reduce server load

- caching plugins: WPFC
- server side caching: done on the server (by the host) using tools like Varnish or using multiple caching servers on a single site (reverse proxy)
- browser caching: technique to reduce the # of requests per page by saving images, CSS, and JS files on the user's computer

Content Offloading:

> temporary storage of pages, images, etc to reduce srver load

- CDNs: Cloudflare,
- Static content: static files can be moved to a another server
- multiple hostnames: - ? -
- host feeds separately: toools like Google FeedBurner

Compression:

- minification
- plugins: w3 total cache, ewww image optimizer

other techniques to improve:

- database tuning: plugins like wp optimize, enable output compression via PHP
- adding servers: temporary storage of pages/images to reduce server load, add Load balancers to spread traffic across multiple servers

- CREATE A PAGE OR POST template with a unique header or footer
- make sure to go into the page and change the template
- you can create a custom templte for different blog categories by using the filter option
- landing page template - no header or footer - use for social media or in an email

.......................................................................

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Introduction to theme.json

> https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/introduction-to-theme-json/

> EXCELLENT

- to control the settings and styles to the blocks in the editor
- **if you wipe everything out of theme.json except schema, and type `""` you will see an auto-suggest - select "version" and it will auto-populate the latestversion number**
- WP core ships with a default theme.json
- the "settings" key is where the developer can extend the default theme.json or enable/disable specific theme settings & functionality, as well as configure new CSS variables
- these settings can then be applied to the theme globally or to specific block elements
- settings > appearanceTools - it is disabled by default - this setting controls all of the following features on blocks that support them:
  - border color, radius, style, and width
  - setting link color
  - block gap, margin, and padding
  - text line-height
- the ability to enable or disable theme specific settings in theme.json replaces the requirement for `add_theme_support` in functions.php
- e.g., custom colors for elements in the site editor - just click the color setting and change - to disable that in a classic theme is `add_theme_support('disable-custom-colors')` - to disable the custom color picker in theme.json:

```json
"settings": {
  "color": {
    "custom": false,
    "palette": [
      {
        "name": "Alt",
        "color": "#135e96",
        "slug": "alt"
      }
    ]
  },
  "blocks": {
    "core/paragraph": {
      "color": {
        "custom": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- however you could enable the custom color picker for a specific block(s) still under the "settings" key
- it is possible to set preset css variables for a theme
- to add a new color to the color palette - add a new color object under settings.color.palette which is an array and would appear under THEME
- doing that creates a new CSS variable for the color - the format for the variable is `--wp--preset--color--{slug}` or `--wp--preset--color--alt`
- to style all text across the entire theme/site - use the "styles" key

```json
"styles": {
  "color": {
    "text": "var(--wp--preset--color--alt)"
  }
}
```

- to apply the color to a specific block, remove the global text color and apply it to the specific block in the blocks scheme
- you could do the same for the "elements" key for buttons

```json
"styles": {
  "elements": {
    "button": {
      "color": {
        "background": "var(--wp--preset--color--alt)"
      }
    }
  }
  "blocks": {
    "core/post-content": {
      "color": {
        "text": "var(--wp--preset--color--alt)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> https://youtu.be/fW4xhwjfyeY?si=fr8qcvlPqTnWUCh2 > https://wpengine.com/builders/wordpress-contextual-patterns/

- if you click the 1st icon on the floating toolbar you can transform the block into different blocks
- what a contextual block does is to transform blocks into patterns and takes the content from the original block and sticks it into the block inside of the pattern

## âœ… Streamline your Block Theme development with Create Block Theme

> https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/streamline-your-block-theme-development-with-create-block-theme/

- works in conjuction with the site editor
- blank theme, child,
- they no longer have an option for google fonts
- for a blank theme only the theme name is needed - that creates templates/index.html, style.css, theme.json and a few other files
- EXPORT: saving global styles saves them to the db but you can use create block theme to write files to the theme and remove the changes from the DB
- CHILD: only a few changes made
- CLONE: when you want more than a child theme, still tied to parent
