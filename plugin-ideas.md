# Block Plugin Ideas

1. Table of Contents: On a single post template, maybe page template, in the query loop, add code to grab the headings text and create a bulleted list - give the user options to deselect heading levels like h4-h6,
2. Breadcrumbs: on posts - need to maybe read permalinks settings or split the url from the slug to get the various parts of the link and needs to go in header
3. Open Graph / Structured Data - this needs to go in the head element and I am new to open graph and structured data
4. a Block for a testimonial
5. a Block for a card: services card, pricing card, team member card, product card, etc
6. copyright block to go at the end of posts
7. Something for SVG images/icons???
