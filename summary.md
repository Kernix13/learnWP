Developing:

1. languages: HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, REST API, JavaScript, AJAX

General Notes:

- there are two main types of templates: multi-use templates and single use templates - You can create custom multi-use templates
- There is a Header Area, a Content Area, and a Footer Area
- You use the Site Editor to build the overall structure, layout, and design aspects of your "theme" by managing your templates, template parts, and styles
- you don’t want to add page or post specific content to multi-use templates like Pages and Single Post
- these multi-use templates must include the "`Content`" block
- multi-use templates: you’ll see dynamic placeholder blocks for your content such as Content, Title, Featured Image, ...
- **You may decide to add a Cover block, assign it to use the Featured Image, and place the page or post Title block in the Cover block — this would then act as a custom header per page or post, and will be dynamic for each page or post**
- you may decide to add a Columns block with a wide left column for your Content block and a narrow right column to set up a sidebar
- keep a clear distinction between page and post content vs templates
- Single-use templates: the content they display is controlled directly in the template - Home Front Page, 404, Search
- When working with a single-use template, you are editing the content directly in the template
- There won’t be a Content block, and there may or may not be a Query Loop block. Whatever content you want these templates to display, you add, remove, and edit it in the template
- the All Archives is a type of single-use template in that you don’t specifically assign this template to individual pages or posts. Instead, this template is used to create the desired layout structure for custom post types such as: authors, categories, tags, and more
- You can also use Block Patterns within these templates to help with quickly creating professional layout designs
- The Search Results page comes with a Query Loop block in place and pre-configured to display your search results
- Template parts: is a reusable synced pattern of blocks that can be placed within multiple templates
- Template parts cannot be used directly within Pages or Posts, they’re only available for Templates
  - `Header`: It may be nested inside other blocks such as a Group or Column - 3 vert dots > replace header
  - `Content`: This is a placeholder block to represent where in your template your regular page or post content will be displayed. This block is required for any multi-use templates
  - `Query Loop`: This is a dynamic block used to display the published posts in your site
  - `Footer`: It’s not typically nested inside other blocks. It’s usually the last block on any template and spans the full width of the template
- You can replace an existing template part on any given template by following these steps: 1) Select the specific template part in the List View, 2) Click the 3 dots on in the toolbar, 3) Select Replace
- **A common use case for this is when you want your homepage to display a larger, hero image type header with a call-to-action button, but you want a simple, single row header on the rest of your pages**
- some blocks have a lock icon next to them in the List View. This is a good reminder that you shouldn’t delete that particular block
- If you’ve set up a Custom Posts Page, and you want the page to display the full content of each of your posts, you can add the Content block instead of the Excerpt block, within the Query Loop block
- Layouts are the arrangement of blocks, also called patterns, that you use on pages, posts, and templates
- **Synced patterns**: you can arrange blocks in unlimited ways and save them as patterns for use throughout your site, directly within the editing experience. You can also specify whether to sync your patterns or to keep them unsynced
- CREATE A SIDEBAR IN A TEMPLATE:
  - make sure the Content block is inside a group block
  - inside add a 66/33 columns block and set to Wide Width or Full Width
  - drag Content block into the left column (you may need to Unlock the Content block before moving it)
  - Click the + sign inside the column on the right and add whatever blocks you’d like your sidebar to display
- You can replace the default Header and/or Footer template parts
- **Pro-tip**: For a consistent and straightforward website design experience we recommend using the Default Homepage and creating a Custom Posts Page
- With a Custom Posts Page, you have complete control over the layout of the page.
- And with the ability to now create custom templates, you have more control than ever to make your Posts page look exactly the way you want
- Custom Headers: open list view > click Header > click the 3 vertical dots with the Header selected > select "Detach blocks from template part" > Save > Save
- the Cover element and you can drag the bottom part to shrink or enlarge that block - you can change the focal point
- **Page Editor**: where you add your content via blocks for pages and posts
- **Site Editor**: use blocks for your structure/templates
- The Site Editor makes global changes, Page Editor only changes that page/post
- Site Editor: click the styles icon > then the reverse circle-arrow icon - you can revert to a previous version - the 3 vert dots to the right has a Additional CSS option
- Media Library: photos, graphics (gif, png, svg), audio, PDF, spreadsheets, PowerPoint, video, word docs, .txt,
- 3 links at bottom: view attachment page, edit more details, download file - also delete permanently
- edit image button: crop, scale, rotation
- in settings > media - the thumbnail is cropped to be square, the other 2 are for it to size to the first dimension that meets the number (300 w or 300 h)
- Pattern Directory: can add one to theme.json with the slug
- a contextual block transforms blocks into patterns and takes the content from the original block and sticks it into the block inside of the pattern
- Create Block Theme: only the theme name is needed - creates templates/index.html, style.css, theme.json and a few other files
- you can use create block theme to write files to the theme and remove the changes from the DB
- CLONE: when you want more than a child theme, still tied to parent
- Reusable blocks are not Synced Patterns???
- Navigation block > Page List block - select it and in the sidebar click edit to "detach" the page list so that you can manage the nav items individually
- when you select the navigation block you can click the 3 verrt dots for it in the right sidebar to 1) create a new menu, or 2) select another menu you created
- `Group`, Row, `Columns`, Cover, and `Media & Text` Block are the best way to group content together
- Navigation: Home Link block
- Layout: use Patterns - if you create a design in the block editor click the 3 vert dots > select Create pattern
- when you add a query loop block you can choose Start Blank or Choose for a pattern
- for featured image, be sure to change the aspect ratio so all the posts look the same
- Cover block: to display text and other content on top of an image or video - it's another type of container block - To prevent your image being cropped on mobile change the aspect ratio
- Separator block - wide line - ???
- remember click on the three vertical dots next to the name and select "Clear Customizations". This will revert back to the original state of the template
- click Header > click the 3 vert dots and select "Detach"
- Custom template: when you get the popup "Choose a template" you can click "Skip" - for a Landing Page, only add a `/content` block and make it full width
- DNS records - see "Domain management: Understanding DNS records" in intermediateWP.md

External sites:

- font pairing: check out https://www.fontpair.co/all
- color palettes: https://coolors.co/palettes/trending
- kw research, try https://www.wordstream.com/keywords
- https://squoosh.app/ - can save as webp

SEO & accessibility

- kw research, try https://www.wordstream.com/keywords and enter a url for a competitor site
- linking: site structure - crawlers use links to understand your site structure and look for more similar content - link to your own posts
- use quality external links
- metadata: description using a plugin always use a quality excerpt as WP uses them to write meta descriptions
- site speed: very important - host speed, caching, fast/slow theme, optimized images, ...
- good image file names and alt text
- sitemap - good for indexing
- Local SEO: local seo kw research, contact info on your contact page, post localized content, get local backlinks,
- headings help readers naviagte your post and are essential for acccessibility
- Common categories of accessibility issues: low contrast text, missing form input labels, empty buttons, no image alt text, empty links

Performance Notes:

- reduce plugins
- optimize images, reduce file size, minify
- use server caching
- modify your server: `Apache Litespeed`, or modify site configuration using `MemCache`
- PHP accelerators like `APc` and `OPcache`
- MySQL optimization
- Server caching:
- CDNs: Cloudflare
- database tuning: plugins like wp optimize, enable output compression via PHP
- HTTPS: ensures that no info is passed in plain text

Blocks:

- generic `/embed` block - you can display content from other sites
- if embed blocks don't work, use the `/html` block (Custom HTML) - you need this for Facebook and Instagram posts
- Embeds: videos, social posts, maps, audio, crowd signal surveys, ...
- NOTE: you can transform an embed into a Columns or Group block so you can change the background color or layout
- if the Embed block does not work you can use the `Custom HTML` block
- for `/query loop` you can click Choose to select from different varieties

Install:

- install: db name, db username, db pw, db host (?), table prefix (change for security reasons)
- site title, username, pw, email,
- login - /wp-admin

## misc

- `ch` units: > between 45 and 75 chars per line, max = 85, 55-65 ideal

```css
li:not([class]),
p:not([class]),
ul:not([class]), {
ol:not([class]) {
  max-width: 75ch;
}
/* Also consider article, section */
/* And always use max-width as opposed to width */
```

- .spamassasin - see that in one of the videos, file manager
- otter blocks: https://wordpress.org/plugins/otter-blocks/

```php
// in wp-config.php
define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
// when resolved replace all above with:
define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );
```
