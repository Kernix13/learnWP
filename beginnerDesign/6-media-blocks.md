## Using a plugin to create a carousel slider

> https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/using-a-plugin-to-create-a-carousel-slider/

Web carousels are often an elegant way to group or organize related content into one space, enabling you to create visual connections between related pieces of information

### Plugins

MetaSlider, Smart Slider 3, and Carousel Slider Block for Gutenberg

### MetaSlider

click on “Add New”, “Add slide” and then select the relevant images from your Media Library. Once you add the slideshow, there are a variety of options to choose from: Mobile options, advanced options, accessibility options, and even developer options

### Carousel Slider Block for Gutenberg

- you can add it as a block and it supports adding other blocks to slides
- it is compatible with WooCommerce
- `/slider` to add the block - start adding blocks within
- Once inserted, you can modify it like any other block
- select the parent block and then change the alignment to wide width
- adjust the number of slides to show
- you can select how many slides you want to scroll at a time and then slide animation speed
- the arrows and dots navigation have been toggled on

It is also advised to avoid auto-scrolling and autoplay to give your audience more control and avoid any accessibility problems. If the slider auto-plays, there should be a pause control. And if you were wondering RTL in WordPress refers to the support for languages written from right to left. Below the responsive settings, you can add a breakpoint and decide how many slides you want to display when it reaches that screen size. When you select an Image block, you can set an aspect ratio to ensure that all images appear the same size.

- this block allows you to add an Image block and other blocks as well - e.g., cover block with heading, text and button

### Accessibility

note that sliders can sometimes cause accessibility issues. It is therefore important to add alt text to images so that the slider you are using can be operated via the keyboard and interact with screen readers
