# Get Design: Using the Site Editor to build your custom theme

## Your first template: Create a style guide using the site editor

> https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/your-first-template-create-a-style-guide-using-the-site-editor/

One best practice theme designers often use is to create a style guide. This allows them to visualize how their site will look and plan out each building block of their theme before they get started.

if you take the time now to design the building blocks of your theme itself, it will save you time later

Using a style guide will give you one central place to make changes that will occur in many places throughout the theme

### Design Your Style Guide

The first step in designing your theme’s look and feel is to plan out your colors and general designs using your Global Styles

It’s difficult to revise a blank piece of paper, so rather than start from scratch, it’s a good idea to start with a style guide!

a new feature called the “Style Book”, which will help you to see the changes you are making from the beginning

### How You Will Use This Style Guide

This Style Book creates a visual representation of all the styles that will automatically be applied across your website

From colors to fonts to button sizes, this preview gives you a strong idea from the start of a website about what your new block theme will look like

> select the “Eye” icon

Depending on your block themes options, you can make sweeping changes to your fonts, change your background color, and in some themes, change your layout options

This WordPress Style Book provides five tabs:

1. Text
2. Media
3. Design
4. Widgets
5. Theme

The Style Book also allows you to add individual styles onto specific blocks

The Style Book also allows you to double check my website for accessibility

### Set Up Your Block Theme’s Style Book

> Important: Remember, style individual blocks sparingly

This part takes some trial and error! It’s all part of the design process

### User Changes vs. Hard-Coded Theme Defaults

at this stage of design, the choices you will make in your blank theme’s global settings are not hard-coded into the theme

user changes: override any code that exists in the theme

In order to save your theme choices so that they become the theme’s defaults, you will need to make these changes permanent in the theme files themselves, moving from a user change to the theme defaults

### Making User Changes Permanent: Transforming Into Theme Defaults

There are two ways you can “save” your changes so that they become your custom theme’s new default state

1. Manually export your theme - this will Create a second, duplicate zipped theme, Hard-code the selections you’ve made in the site editor to the second, duplicated theme itself, Require you to install your second, duplicated theme in order to make future changes

- If you choose this option, you will have a SECOND, duplicated theme that you will have to install to your WordPress installation in order to make future changes
- This can be helpful if you want to save several versions of your theme

2. Use the open-source plugin, Create Block Theme - this will Make the changes you made in your style guide permanent - This saves your changes directly to your theme — it does not make a duplicate

## Selecting your theme's default fonts

> https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/selecting-your-themes-default-fonts/

- it’s a good idea to consider your audience and their expectations for the type of theme you are designing
- Make sure that any font you choose is easily readable
- Make sure any font that you choose is open source

open-source fonts:

- https://fonts.google.com/
- https://www.fontspace.com/category/open
- https://fontlibrary.org/
- https://usemodify.com/
- https://www.fontsquirrel.com/

If you get an error when you go to the “Manage theme fonts” section, it likely means that your theme.json file is missing its typography setting. Go back to module 3 and add that code in order to resolve the problem

- Download the font files, including additional weights you would like to make available
- Upload your font files in assets/fonts

## Using patterns to design your header and footer template parts

> https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/using-patterns-to-design-your-header-footer-template-parts/

Many theme designers start with their template parts

### Creating Your First Template Part

1. Select ‘Template Parts’
2. Select ‘Add New’
3. Select ‘Header’ (or ‘Footer’, depending on what you want to create first!)
4. Select ‘Create’

There may be specific instances on specific blocks where you want to use the ‘settings’ section of your editor to select a choice; however, the goal of good site design is to only design once, to save on time and efficiency.

Do your very best to stylize as much as you can using the half-moon shaped “styles” settings as you design
