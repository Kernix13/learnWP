the seven steps to creating happy customers:

1. Choosing an audience
2. Finding a problem to solve
3. Selling your product before you make it
4. Creating the product
5. Choosing an operating system
6. Delivering the product to your customer
7. Creating happy customers

### Choosing an audience

- instead of making a product and then findding people to sell it, first find who you are serving and what problem do they have and what can you do to solve that problem
- When you choose a specific audience, it gives you the opportunity to be able to communicate really clearly with that audience
- It allows you to focus on the value that you can provide for that audience and that audience's problems and it allows you to differentiate yourself

there's two typical approaches that that you can take to choose an audience.

1. One is to choose the audience that you're already connected to that you know well.
2. Another is to choose is to work with someone, rather, who has an audience that they're connected to - it can work just as well to work with someone else who knows an audience really well and work through them

as you think about how to narrow down an audience, there's a few things to keep in mind. There's two ways that we typically see that there are external similarities

The idea that you take things that you can see about an audience you could take where they live, you could take their age, you could take gender, you could take their income, which is a little bit trickier. But you get this idea that you can that's a fairly common way - demographics!

What we find is that the entrepreneurs who are most successful will take external as a factor, but will actually focus on internal similarities instead

they're most commonly summed up in `shared interests`, people who might look very different and still care about similar things

I don't want to limit myself. I want to go big. The more that you choose, the more that you're specific, the more that you can focus in on providing value for that audience

### Finding a problem to solve

Step number two is find a problem to solve - You want to focus on finding the problem that you can solve for them - things that people will pay money to solve

the way that I find it most helpful to think about problems is to think about them as unmet needs - And as you do that, there's a lot of categories you can break it down to - There are physical needs (hunger, thirst, sleep) - There are mental needs (learning, boredom, inspiration) - practical needs (clothing, cooking ingredients)

So you've chosen an audience. And as you look, as you work with that audience, you want to focus on understanding what are their unmet needs. Where are the areas that they have problems now?

How do you choose? Well, there's a few different ways that you can go about this.

there tends to be two primary approaches:

1. You can focus on identifying the biggest problems, the biggest sort of unmet needs that your audience has and where presumably they're the most incentivized to get them solved
2. Or you can focus on the tiny problems that sort of create momentum in a direction by getting this solved. It makes other things in their life easier

ultimately you want to focus on what's a best fit for what you're capable of serving - You sort of narrow that list down and consider both considered the big problems and the opportunity that you have to solve those and consider small problems that build momentum in a positive direction. So choose a problem.

focus on following their lead. Talk to your audience as you're building out that list of potential problems and let them sort of fill in blanks for you

Remember that people can't always articulate what it is that is a problem for them. So a lot of it just needs to be focused on listening, reading between the lines, having multiple conversations with multiple folks in your audience, put that list together and ultimately choose a problem where you can focus on having an impact, either a big one or a small one that can build momentum over time and follow their lead and making that choice

### Selling your product before you make it

Now, that takes us to step number three

And step number three is to sell it before you make it. Now, what's this about? At the heart of all of this is to make sure that the idea that you have resonates with your audience - that it's actually something that is going to work for them. And one of the best ways is to find out if it's going to work is if they're willing to pay for it or not - until they're willing to spend money on it, it's really hard to know

this is really about the concept of testing something with your audience before you commit to making it, make sure that the idea you have is something that's going to actually be valuable for them

The first is that testing something, selling something before you make it helps make sure that your problem or your product rather solves a real problem for them

When people say, yes, I would pay for that, that's an indicator that you're going the right direction. Selling something before you make it also helps you make your product better as you get feedback from folks, especially if they know that you're early on in the process, they might say, yes, I want. And can you make it do this or can you offer in this option as well before you commit to the manufacturer in the creation of your product, selling it can give you just incredibly valuable insight into how you can make your product even better as you created for them

And last but not least, selling something before you make it helps to reduce the risk to you as an entrepreneur, to the business that you're creating, making sure that you don't buy too much inventory or making sure that you don't overinvest in an aspect of the product that they don't actually care about

what are some of the ways that you can sell something before you make it create an offer for them? There's a lot of simple ways that you can do this. A common one is put up a website where you put the offer out there and have a preorder button or a waiting list that they get on. But that doesn't matter nearly as much as getting the offer out

There might just be a conversation that you have with a bunch of folks in your audience or emails that you send out but create an offer tested, repeat the process as needed until you you're sure that you've got something that solves a real problem for the audience that you picked

### 4. Creating the product

This is where the magic comes in - as the entrepreneur, you've got the ideas, you've got the capability to make something incredible or, you know, someone who does that you can work with

there's so much here as a human that you can really bring into the mix and put new ideas and concepts together to provide value for your audience. As you're making the product. I'll just offer you a few pieces of guidance to keep in mind.

1. _The first is to start small_ - Oftentimes we can at this stage have some pretty grand ambitions and want to just go really big. That's great. Keep that there. And I encourage you to start small and just make sure that you're staying problem focused and providing value to the audience that you picked
2. The second thing to keep in mind is just to look for ways to _make the creation process as simple as possible_. If you've got ideas for making it better, and especially if those ideas involve more complexity, take notes to them, store them away. But don't focus on that early on

> Start small and keep it simple

### 5. Choosing an operating system

We have operating systems on our phones, on our computers these days and our cars and in our even in some of our appliances

For eCommerce, there are two types of operating systems for you to be thinking about. There are proprietary operating systems and there are open source operating systems - these are operating systems that you use to create an online store on the open web

- WordPress: creating content, e-commerce, et cetera, on the open web
- Shopify

There are pros and cons to each. And I'm going to encourage you to focus on three particular concepts to consider, rather three concepts.

1. The first is ownership

with open source the because of how it's licensed, the way that the open source code base, open source concept ecosystem works, you are owning it - You can do whatever you want with it. When you choose to use open source software, there's a part of ownership that comes with that

With proprietary software, it's more like you're renting it because it's owned by someone else

> ownership is an important concept to keep in mind

2. The second thing to keep in mind is flexibility

When you're choosing an operating system, consider how important flexibility is to you. Do you need to be able to customize it? Do you have something that's a little different in mind with the product that you're creating for the customers that you're serving?

3. And the third thing to keep in mind is community

with open source...part of the WordPress ecosystem community is a huge factor. There's so many people because that sense of shared ownership who are willing to spend their time and energy helping you succeed, because in doing so, we're also helping ourselves succeed as the more as more people have success on open source

> As you choose an operating system, _ownership_, _flexibility_ and _community_, we recommend WordPress and within WordPress for ecommerce

Three common examples are commerce. Another one is easy digital downloads. Another one is member press. Each one of these has different pros and cons

### 6. Delivering the product to your customer

there's a couple of things to keep in mind here - focus on two pieces that's packaging and the delivery process

So for packaging the priority here...assuming for a moment that you're making a physical product with digital, obviously it's a bit different, but with physical products, the focus is on safety, making sure that the product arrives to your customer safely - You want to focus on keeping your customer informed about the delivery process, where their product is at in the process and making sure that they have that information so they can know what to expect

making sure that you've chosen the best delivery options for your customer and the type of product that you have available don't just make assumptions. Oftentimes, you're limited here with what's available in the country that you're focused on serving. But there more than there are usually several options to pick from. And within those you want to focus on just what's best for your audience now

The thing to keep in mind about delivery and getting the product to your customer, whether it's physical or digital, is the overall experience. What's that experience like for your customer and focus on just making sure that you're doing creating this experience with your audience in mind, with the problem that you're focused on solving in mind? And just how can you give them the best experience as possible and route to solving that problem?

### 7. Creating happy customers

you could get a customer, but we want a happy customer, happy customer, someone who is going to have success with your product or is more likely to have success with your product as they do so, they're more likely to tell others about it, become ambassadors for you

And there's two things in particular to keep in mind, as you especially when you're getting started.

1. First is how important communication is - The communication that you have with your customer goes such a long way to influence the relationship that they're going to have with your product and the experience that they're going to have
2. the second thing to keep in mind as you work on that communication is to focus on the long term. It's easy in the world of commerce to focus on volume and just the transactions and forget that there's very real people on the other side that have problems to solve

think about it in terms of building relationship, that's the key thing to focus on there, that it's not just the transaction, it's the relationship that comes with it

And as you communicate with them, think about ways within the audience that you've chosen the problem that you're focused on solving to provide additional value to them. What kind of information can you share that helps to open their thinking to new possibilities and provides additional value within that problem that you're wanting to solve for them?

...let's look back over the seven steps first...

- choose an audience as you go about choosing audience, focus on being specific
- find a problem to solve
- sell something before you make it - Make sure that you're focused on solving real problems
- create the product and as you do so, just make sure that you stay problem focused
- choose an operating system - favor open source
- Then you want to get your product to your customer and focus on the overall experience
- creating happy customers - focus on building long term relationships

go beyond your first customer and continue building

- focus continually on communication, interacting with your customers, learning from them and taking what you learn to improve the product that you're creating and the experience that you're building around that product
- be curious about things, attend other workshops - be generally curious about the space that you're in and look for opportunities to learn
- join a WP oe ecommerce community - people are willing to share and teach - look for ways that you can share what you've learned as well - Find local meetups and attend online events within the ecosystem that you choose
