# Designing your website

## Selecting and activating a block theme

> https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/selecting-and-activating-a-block-theme/

The theme affects the website’s loading time, user experience, search engine optimization, and much more. Therefore, using the right WordPress theme that suits your website’s niche, functionality, and branding is important

A theme is basically a website template with a certain layout and design. When you use WordPress, your content is completely separated from its presentation. This means that the look and feel of your site can change completely by just using a different theme while your content remains the same.

A block theme is a theme that is built using blocks as the building blocks for creating content. Block themes are designed to be used with the WordPress block editor, also known as the Gutenberg editor.

## The Site Editor and the Page Editor

> https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/the-site-editor-and-the-page-editor/

### Where does your content/writing/media live?

Your content live in a different dashboard than the Site Editor

#### How do I know the difference between the Site Editor and the Page / Post Editor?

The Pages / Posts Editor does not have a global styles icon in the top right-hand corner

### Why is content (post and pages) separate from structure (the site editor)?

**Keeping your content separate from your website’s design allows you to change themes without losing any writing, media, or ideas**

The page editor and website editor look very similar, but do very different things

### Key Differences in the Block Editor and Site Editor

> The Site Editor Templates Are Like Picture Frames

The header makes up the top of the frame; the footer makes up the bottom of the frame. Some websites even include sidebars, like the sides of the frame

The key here is that the template (the picture frame) structure doesn’t change, no matter what content (the picture) you put into the frame

### Posts and Pages are Like the Photos In the Picture Frame

Meanwhile, posts and pages are like the photos you put within the picture frame.

You can change the picture within the frame, but the template’s key components–the headers and footers all stay in place

## Styling your site globally

> https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/styling-your-site-globally/

Think back to the color palette you decided upon for your website and the fonts you decided that you are going to use; now is the time to use them

### Introduction to the Site Editor and Template Editor

We are going to start by working in our WordPress Site Editor, which is where you will work on your website’s look, feel, and (eventually) structure

### Let’s get styling! Style your new WordPress website

The first step in styling your website occurs in your block theme’s site editor. This editor is meant to help you picture the overall look and feel of your website. It is meant to structure your website

...where each page’s header appears, what colors will be automatically applied to all your blocks, and how your text appears, to name a few

...start by applying your colors and fonts using the WordPress Stylebook

### Use the WordPress Stylebook to style your block theme

the stylebook has 5 tabs:

1. text
2. media
3. design
4. widgets
5. theme

### Should you style each block individually?

While you certainly CAN do so, it is recommended you do so sparingly. Why? To avoid a theme design headache in the future, it is recommended that you stylize individual blocks sparingly and generally use your main options under “Styles” to make big, sweeping changes

if you make an individual change to a block's style in the stylebook, any other changes that you make globally will not affect that block you edited - if you want it to change you will have to style it again

to set an individual's block back to the default, click on it again then go into each setting and change it back to `Default`

## Building your header and footer in the Site Editor

> https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/building-your-header-and-footer-in-the-site-editor/

### Header template parts

- templates are used to create a design for a web page.
- A template provides the structure for a page’s display and includes things like a header, content, and a footer
- header at the top of a template, your footer at the bottom and the Post Content block in the middle

> You don’t add content to templates. The content from a page or post will be pulled in by the `Post Content` block

- When you create a template, you get the best use when you separate the reusable parts from the dynamic part.
- The dynamic part is the content part that will change for every page or post that uses the template
- The reusable parts are the static parts of the template that will stay the same: header, footer, and sidebar template parts
- Once you have created a template part, you can reuse it or edit it.
- When you change blocks inside a template part, the Editor will update the blocks on every block template using this template
- A header pattern is a pre-made header design that is ready to use or modify. Instead of nesting and grouping blocks together, patterns have already done that for you

### Setting up your footer

## Setting up main pages and adding content

> https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/setting-up-main-pages-and-adding-content/

The content you add to a WordPress business website is extremely important for several reasons:

- Communicating your message
- SEO
- User experience: Visitors to your website will quickly leave if they can’t find what they’re looking for or if the content is poorly written or confusing
- Building trust and credibility

### Mobile Responsiveness

The good news is that all block themes are responsive. However, there are still some things you can do to ensure your website is optimized for mobile

- Cover blocks can cause a problem, so ensure that the contrast between the text and images is clear, and use images that don’t cut off on mobile.
- Remember to select ‘Stack on mobile’ in the sidebar settings for Columns blocks etc.
- Design with accessibility in mind (opens in a new tab). Also, remember that an accessible site equals a faster site and usually better SEO scores.
- Guard against information overload. Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and subheadings to break up your content and make it easy to read on a small screen.
- Too many dropdowns and submenus can be overwhelming and hard on smaller devices.
- Design for mobile first and optimize for desktop.
- E-commerce sites should allow users to check out immediately.
- Try to design to allow users to accomplish what they need in three clicks.
- Footers are just as important as headers.
- Choose mobile-friendly fonts: Select a font that is easy to read on a small screen. Avoid using small fonts or fonts with thin strokes that can be difficult to read on mobile devices.
- Test your website on different devices: Finally, test your website on different devices to ensure that it looks and functions correctly on all screen sizes.

### Building your pages

- Utilize your keyword list
- Embed calls-to-action on each page
- Build your credibility page by page; while your ‘About’ page will likely contain the majority of your credentials, consider where else in your website you can include credibility-boosting content

Create high-quality, informative content that accurately represents your business and its offerings

### Home Page

The Home Page is the first page visitors will see when visiting your website. Making a good first impression is important, so you want to ensure your home page is attractive, informative and easy to navigate

- Hero Image: Use a high-quality, eye-catching image representing your business and services. This can be an image of your team, equipment, or work.

- Services Overview: Briefly summarize your services and what differentiates you from your competitors.
- Testimonials: Include testimonials from satisfied customers to build trust and credibility. In our example, we decided to add our Testimonials section to our About Page.

### Services Page

The Services Page is where you’ll go into more detail about your services

- Service Descriptions: Include detailed descriptions of the services you offer. Use bullet points or numbered lists to make it easy to read.
- Service Images: Include images of your team working on different types of projects, or before-and-after images of your work.
- Pricing: If possible, include pricing information for your services or a link to ‘Get a Quote’ button.
- Add effective Call-To-Actions.
- Organize your services into categories or subcategories to make it easier for visitors to navigate and find what they are looking for.
