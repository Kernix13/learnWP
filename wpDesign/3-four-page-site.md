# Extending your website

## Include a Blog or News page

> https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/include-a-blog-or-news-page-optional/

One key component of a strong business website is writing frequent updates, which alerts both readers and search engines that you maintain an active presence and have the most up-to-date content possible. This means you often rank higher in search engines and readers trust your content is accurate and relevant to them today

### Static vs. Changing Content

consider including a blog or news page, which allows you to write, schedule, and publish regular updates–big and small!–to keep your website up-to-date

### News Page

One of the easiest ways to incorporate frequently changing content is to include a news page or section on your website

News can include:

- Store closures for holidays,
- New hours of operation,
- Exciting special events,
- A new team member joining,
- A policy change, or
- Any other change in your business your customers may want to know about!

### Blog Page

Short-Form Articles:

- Quick, “Did you know?” articles
- “Customer Spotlight”
- Generally between 150-350 words and use 3 or fewer images

Long-Form Articles:

- 500, 800, or even 1000 words!
- Imagine these like magazine articles about something related to your business.
- Break up your text into short paragraphs
- Use headings appropriately to ‘frame’ your content
- Vary paragraph length.

Listicles:

- 5 things everyone loves about…
- 10 products you need to…
- A list with a little extra info!

Interviews:

- Interview a staff member
- Interview an expert in your field
- Interview a customer

### Categories

A word or short phrase that groups ideas together – think about them as topics that need to be separated

Category Best Practices

- Aim to use only one or two categories per post
- Are meant to separate ideas under your one topic

### Tags

Tags are similar to categories – however, they are a more more free-form way to add keywords to posts. Think of tags like things that join topics

Tags Best Practices

- Don’t add too many tags, up to 10 tags should suffice.
- Make sure your tags are relevant – they should directly relate to the content of the post you are writing.
- Don’t use tags that don’t relate your current post to any other post on your site.
- Remember your keyword research (opens in a new tab)? Do any of those top keywords relate to your blog post? If so, be sure to use them in your tags section!
- Note: If your post does not relate to a high-ranking keyword, it’s a best practice NOT to include that keyword
- Only use tags that relate directly to your content.

### Does your blog have multiple sections?

Imagine you want to separate your business’ news from your blog itself. Is it possible to create two separate blog sections? The short answer is “yes!”

Use query loops to separate them
