_Directions_: Take a few minutes to look up websites similar to yours — these may be your direct competition, or from similar businesses located in another location from yours.

Write down what you notice:

1. What are things they do well?
   1. What do you notice about their images? Colors?
   2. What builds trust? What is something you will emulate ?What is something you will do differently?
2. Compare and contrast at least two different (but similar!) websites and write down what you notice.
   1. What are some common qualities these websites have?
   2. What makes one business stand out from another?
   3. What calls to action are they using? In other words, what are they asking people to do on each page?

## Planning your website’s look and feel

Once you have your ideas in place, it’s important to consider both design and loading speed — there are a few things to consider and do before you dive into your WordPress dashboard

### Color Palette (and Color Accessibility)

Now that you have done some research on similar websites to the one you hope to create, it’s important to consider your color palette.

The goal of a strong color palette is to make sure your website is both accessible and consistent across all pages.

- What colors work for your business type?
- What colors did competitor websites use?
- What colors did these websites seem to avoid?

### Your Theme’s Styles: Fonts and Colors

People who visit your website will have differing levels of visual ability. Your website’s audience or customer might:

- Be fully colorblind: Only see the world in black and white
- Be partially colorblind: For example, some people are not able to distinguish between reds and greens, though there are many different kinds of colorblindness
- Have low vision, making small text hard or impossible to read
- May use screen readers to access the information on your website

### Common Mistakes

- Not using high enough color contrast
- Using color alone to indicate information - Did someone make an unsuccessful payment on your website? Don’t just use the color red–ensure there is text as well so people who are colorblind can access the information

Ask yourself:

- What will be your base color
- What will be your contrast
- What will be your primary, secondary, and tertiary colors

### Picking Fonts

...the ability to access and use the Font Library. This tool simplifies font management across your site, allowing you to install, use, and remove custom fonts

If you want to upload a licensed web font from your computer, click on Upload and then select the file. To install fonts from Google Fonts, click on the Install Fonts tab. The fonts you install will be downloaded from Google and stored on your site. That means it’s locally hosted. Locally hosted fonts make your site faster and protect your visitors’ privacy

> Pro-Tip: Pick up to two fonts to utilize throughout your website.

### Images/ Photos

Before you start gathering images, you need to define the visual style of your website. This includes the color scheme, typography, and overall design aesthetic. Now that you have a clear idea of your website’s style, you can start looking for images that fit that style

- Identify the types of images you need - Make a list of the different types of images you need with a short description
- start looking for them: pixabay.com, pexels.com, unsplash.com,

Optimizing Images for Speed and SEO:

- Search engines rank faster websites higher in search results than slower loading ones
- Studies have shown that if a website takes 2 seconds to load, up to 10% of potential customers leave for another website
- If a website takes 3 seconds to load, that number jumps between 30-50%!
- Make sure you choose the correct image type
- Scale and compress images
  - 1200 by 628 pixels is a good size for header images
  - For other images, the optimal size is at least 640 by 480 and up to around 1024 by 768 pixels
- Change the file name of an image before uploading it to the Media Library - image SEO starts with the file name - You want a search engine to know what the image is without even looking at it
- Add alternative text when an image is uploaded to your Media Library
